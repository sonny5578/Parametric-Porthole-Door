I'll do a proper Description and Build guide at some point probably.

High chamber temp capable extrusion based door.
Intended for 25mm PIR insulation as the porthole relies on the compressive stregth of the PIR to not flap about. Sealing is intended to be done with either silicone tube in the extrusion, silicone tube bonded to the extrusion, or some sort of foam (silicone foam, solimide) bonded to the extrusion. The windows in the portholes are intened to be 5mm thick polycarbonate disks bonded in with RTV.

The panel spacers will be fine printed out of ABS. Print the inner porthole out of something that can withstand your intended chamber temps.

Hinges and closures are up to you.
